ABOUT PROJECT:


The aim of the project is to predict the overall writing quality and answer the question, "Does behavior during writing affect the essay outcome?" To answer this question, we applied machine learning algorithms.

This project was developed as part of a competition. For more details about the competition and to access additional resources, please visit the link:
